# DJO Identity Provider Documentation

This directory contains some *developer* documentation. It describes why certain
choices were made, what dependencies serve which funtions and what the workflow
of the application is.

These will forever be a WIP, as there's always something else to describe.

- [Information concerning dependencies](dependencies.md)
- [Requirements for development](requirements.md)
- [Workflow for the application](workflow.md)
